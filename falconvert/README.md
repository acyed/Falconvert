# Falconvert

I've needed, at certian points in my life, to convert Falconview files to Google Earth KML. In the past, I would just hand-jam the points into a KML file. It took forever. There used to be a tool, included with FV, but it no longer works. 

So, I set out to make my own tool. I also wanted to work in Clojure. The benefit is the jar will work on any NIPR or SIPR system that has java installed. 

Rightnow, Falconvert only works on polygons. No points, text, etc... But that's on the roadmap.
